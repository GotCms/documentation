#Document types

Main purpose of document-type is to link concrete document in content tree with layout and view (which can be connected with script). For example, to create page "Contact" you need to create view with form for entering data (let call it "contact") and wrap it with appropriate page layout creating document-type (let call it "contact" too). After that you create content page and set document type field to "contact" document-type. Now you can injoy result opening /contact page in frontend.
