# An overview of features

## Unlimited hierarchically structured page navigation menu

The page navigation menu provides critical information and functions. It allows you to quickly perform common actions on pages and shows how information has been organized.

## Drag and drop page ordering

This function simplifies the organization of your site’s pages. It makes new sorting arrangements of pages possible.

## Flexible page content: body, sidebar, extended, summary

Each page can have its own customized parts (divisions). It can be ‘extended’ text for news, or ‘summary’ for article: you can define whatever you want, whenever you want. These can even be used for extended metadata fields.

## Per page layout customization

Pages can have their own layout. This allows the site owner to make every page look _exactly_ as desired.

## Simple and reusable content

You can define "views": small pieces of content used across several pages, like page headers or footers, navigation, breadcrumbs, or contact info, etc. This means less cut-and-paste text in your pages. This will reduce your modification time when you need to add, remove or change the text in it.

## Customize the backend

Modules and plugins allow you tu customize backend content via some observer and custom models, views and controllers.

## Password protected administration

## Simple user and permission management

## File manager allows you to upload, browse and edit files
